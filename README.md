NHL-Stats-to-CSV
================

Select NHL stats from 1997-98 to present and output them to a CSV file.

Written in Python.

The "Grouping" option has do to with whether a player was traded or not during the season. 
* By League: A player's stats from different teams will be combined.
* By Team: A player's stats will be separate for each team he played on.

I have noticed a few weird things due to differences in stats recorded for specific years that I already fixed. If you notice any others, let me know.

Currently only the main stats are available ("Summary" on NHL.com). I would like to expand it to include more or all of the stats from the other sections on the site.

This could probably use a good refactoring, maybe later.
